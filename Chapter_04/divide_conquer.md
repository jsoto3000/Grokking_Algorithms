# Grokking Algorithms - Chapter 4
## Divide & Conquer Strategy (D&C)

- D&C
  - Have problem that cannot be solved with learned algorithms
  - Then use D&C, well known recursive technique for problem-solving
  - D&C is not a simple algorith to apply to a problem
    - Instead it is a way to think about a problem 
  - Farmer with a plot of land
    - 1680 meters by 640 meters rectangular plot
    - Need to evenly divide farm into square plots
    - want plots as big as possible
    - how do you figure out the largest square size you can use for a plot of land?
      - Note: this is at its most basic a 'greatest common denominator' (GCD) problem
    - To solve a problem using D&C there are two steps:
      - (1) Figure out the base case (simplest possible case)
      - (2) Divide or decrease your problem until it becomes the base case
    - Base Case (the easiest case)
      - Base case is if one side is a multiple of the other
        - Have a plot of land where one side is 50 meters and the other side is 25 meters
        - Largest plot of land you can have is 25 meters by 25 meters
    - Recursive Case
      - According to D&C, with every recursive call you have to reduce your problem
      - Figure out how to reduce your problem and get to the base case.
      - Use a recursive Euclidean Algorithm to find the GCD.
        - In this case the answer is 80.
    - Binary Search is a D&C algorithm too.
      - Base case for Binary Search ia an array with one item
        - if the item you're looking for in the array, you found it!
        - Otherwise, it is not in the array.
      - In Recursive case split the array in half
        - throw away one half
        - search on other half
