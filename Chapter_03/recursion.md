# Grokking Algorithms - Chapter 3
## Recursion

- Recursion
  - Coding technique used in many algorithms.
  - Elegant way to solve problems.
  - Learn how to break problem down into a base case and recursive case.
    - Divide and Conquer strategy uses this simple concept to solve difficult problems.
  - Recursion is used when it makes the solution clearer.
  - There is no performance benefit to using recursion.
    - Loops are sometimes better for performance.
    - Leigh Caldwell (stackoverflow.com) quote:
      - "Loops may achieve a performance gain for your program."
      - "Recursion may achieve a performance gain for your programmer."
  - 

- Pseudocode
  - High level description of problem
  - Written like code, but closer to human speech

- Recursive Functions
  - Elements can be anywhere in memory. Do not need to be contiguous.
