# Grokking Algorithms - Chapter 4
## Divide & Conquer Strategy (D&C)

- D&C
  - Have problem that cannot be solved with learned algorithms
  - Then use D&C, well known recursive technique for problem-solving
  - D&C is not a simple algorith to apply to a problem
    - Instead it is a way to think about a problem 
  - Farmer with a plot of land
    - 1680 meters by 640 meters rectangular plot
    - Need to evenly divide farm into square plots
    - want plots as big as possible
    - how do you figure out the largest square size you can use for a plot of land?
      - Note: this is at its most basic a 'greatest common denominator' (GCD) problem
      - To solve a problem using D&C there are two steps:
        - (1) Figure out the base case (simplest possible case)
        - (2) Divide or decrease your problem until it becomes the base case
        - Base Case (the easiest case)
          - If one side is a multiple of the other
            - Have a plot of land where one side is 50 meters and the other side is 25 meters
            - Largest plot of land you can have is 25 meters by 25 meters
        - Recursive Case
          - According to D&C, with every recursive call you have to reduce your problem
          - Figure out how to reduce your problem and get to the base case.
          - Use a recursive Euclidean Algorithm to find the GCD.
            - In this case the answer is 80.
  - Binary Search is a D&C algorithm too.
    - Base case for Binary Search ia an array with one item
      - if the item you're looking for in the array, you found it!
      - Otherwise, it is not in the array.
    - In Recursive case split the array in half
      - throw away one half
      - search on other half
  - Quicksort
    - A sorting algorithm
    - Much faster than selection sort
    - One of the fastest sorting algorithms
    - Frequently used
    - Uses D&C
    - Use Quicksort to sort an array
      - Base Case
        - Empty arrays and arrays with only one element
      - Recursive Case
        - Any array with two or more elements
    - The average runtime of quicksort is O(n log n)
      - but in worst case it takes O(n<sup>2</sup>)
    - The constant in Big O notation can matter sometimes
      - That's why quicksort is faster than merge sort
      - However, the const almost never matters for simple search vs binary search
        - O(log n) is os much faster than O(n) as list gets bigger
    - Inductive Proof
      - a way to prove that your algorithm works
      - has two steps:
        - base case
        - inductive case
      - method for proving that a statement P(n) is true for every natural number n,
        - that is, that the infinitely many cases P ( 0 ) , P ( 1 ) , P ( 2 ) , P ( 3 ) , â€¦ all hold. 
        - Informal metaphors help to explain this technique: such as falling dominoes or climbing a ladder:
          - Mathematical induction proves that we can climb as high as we like on a ladder:
            - by proving that we can climb onto the bottom rung (the basis or base case), and 
            - that from each rung we can climb up to the next one (the step or inductive case).
